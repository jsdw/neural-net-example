A highly commented JavaScript implementation of plain feed forward nets with back propagation. The activation function and error function are configurable, as is the size of the network and number of hidden layers. That said, this is really just here for learning, and so it is not particularly optimised for performance or intended for real world usage.

The example network follows the excellent post [here](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example), which runs through the calculations of an example network.

# Running

To run the example network, just run `./example.js`. It should work with any reasonably recent version of NodeJS (tested on 7.3).
